## ðŸ“– DESCRIPTION

### ðŸŽ¯ What is it about?

Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in their own context. This Challenge has been built for a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

### Preview
